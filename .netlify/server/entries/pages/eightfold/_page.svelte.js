<h3>And what is right view?</h3>

<h3>And what is right mindfulness?</h3>
<p>There is the case where a monk remains focused on the body in &amp; of itself — ardent, alert, &amp; mindful — putting aside greed &amp; distress with reference to the world. </p>
<p>He remains focused on feelings in &amp; of themselves — ardent, alert, &amp; mindful — putting aside greed &amp; distress with reference to the world. </p>

<div id="${"FourJhanas"}"></div>
<h3>And what is right concentration?</h3>
<p>There is the case where a monk — quite withdrawn from sensuality, withdrawn from unskillful (mental) qualities — enters &amp; remains in the first jhana:
rapture &amp; pleasure born from withdrawal, accompanied by directed thought &amp; evaluation. </p>
<p>With the stilling of directed thought &amp; evaluation, he enters &amp; remains in the second jhana:
rapture &amp; pleasure born of composure, unification of awareness free from directed thought &amp; evaluation — internal assurance. </p>
<p>With the fading of rapture he remains in equanimity, mindful &amp; alert, physically sensitive of pleasure.
He enters &amp; remains in the third jhana, of which the Noble Ones declare, ‘Equanimous &amp; mindful, he has a pleasurable abiding.’ </p>
<p>With the abandoning of pleasure &amp; pain — as with the earlier disappearance of elation &amp; distress — he enters &amp; remains in the fourth jhana:
purity of equanimity &amp; mindfulness, neither pleasure nor pain. This is called right concentration.</p>
